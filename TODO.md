1. Update Consts 
2. Add loop for combining decks (Will be a semi-manual process)
    2.1. Loop through the "decks" and get all fronts
    2.2. loop through all the "decks" and get the backs 
    2.3. Get the "cadback" for that deck and set that as the default for the first x unless a "backs" slot is found.
